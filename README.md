# Easycurler

Easycurler is a TUI application meant to make HTTP requests easier to form

## Goals

- [ ] Import and export request as curl to be able to share queries and version control
- [ ] Request forming should be easier than curl

## Out of scope currently

- GraphQL etc

## Why easycurler?

- I want TUI request tool to go along with my nvim/lazygit setup
- Postman is very clunky, requires logging in and booting up the app
- With Go I believe I can achieve better responsiveness
